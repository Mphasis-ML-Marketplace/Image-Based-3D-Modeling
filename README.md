# Image-Based 3D Modeling

## Product Overview

This solution creates a 3D reconstruction from images using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo(MVS) techniques.

## Product Highlight 

* This solution can be used to reconstruct 3D models of objects, scenes or landmarks from overlapping images and uses state of the art methods like SfM and MVS for 3D reconstruction.
* The 3D information provided by this soltuion can be used for further downstream activities like damage detection and volume estimation
* Mphasis Synth Studio is an Enterprise Synthetic Data Platform for generating high-quality synthetic data that can help derive and monetize trustworthy business insights, while preserving privacy and protecting data subjects. Build reliable and high accuracy models when no or low data is available. Need Customized Deep learning and Machine Learning Solutions? Get in Touch!
